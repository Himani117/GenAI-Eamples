      "History Tutor:Sindh is a province in southeastern Pakistan that has a rich and ancient history. It is located along the lower Indus River and borders the Arabian Sea to the south. Here are some important points about Sindh:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ancient Civilization: Sindh is home to some of the oldest sites of the Indus Valley Civilization (also known as the Harappan Civilization), which flourished around 2500 BCE. Notable archaeological sites include Mohenjo-daro, one of the world's earliest major cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Strategic Location: Historically, Sindh has been a gateway between South Asia and the Middle East, as it is situated along important trade and migration routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Islamic Conquest: Sindh was one of the first parts of the Indian subcontinent to come under Islamic rule. In 711 CE, the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh, making it the easternmost province of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Cultural Heritage: Sindh is known for its distinct culture, language (Sindhi), music, and Sufi traditions. It has produced many famous poets like Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Colonial and Modern Era: Sindh became part of British India in the 19th century. After the partition of India in 1947, Sindh became a province of the newly formed Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Karachi, the capital of Sindh, is the largest city and economic hub of Pakistan. The province remains significant for its diverse population, economic contributions, and historical sites. If you have questions about any specific period or aspect of Sindh’s history, feel free to ask!\n",

      "\n",
      "2 × 56 ÷ 7 − 45 + 17 × 94\n",
      "\n",
      "We will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which stands for:\n",
      "- Parentheses/Brackets\n",
      "- Exponents/Orders\n",
      "- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n",
      "- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Start with multiplication and division (from left to right):\n",
      "\n",
      "First, calculate 2 × 56:\n",
      "2 × 56 = 112\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, divide 112 by 7:\n",
      "112 ÷ 7 = 16\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the expression looks like:\n",
      "16 − 45 + 17 × 94\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, calculate 17 × 94:\n",
      "17 × 94 = 1598\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Now do addition and subtraction (from left to right):\n",
      "\n",
      "First, 16 − 45:\n",
      "16 − 45 = -29\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, add 1598:\n",
      "-29 + 1598 = 1569\n",
      "\n",
      "Final answer:\n",
      "2 × 56 ÷ 7 − 45 + 17 × 94 = 1569\n",
      "\n",
      "Example using similar steps:\n",
      "Suppose you had the expression 3 × 10 ÷ 5 + 4 × 8\n",
      "3 × 10 = 30\n",
      "30 ÷ 5 = 6\n",
      "4 × 8 = 32\n",
      "Now, 6 + 32 = 38\n",
      "\n",
      "So the method is the same: multiply and divide, then add or subtract in order!\n",
